---

each composition resides in a separate directory and contains separate README.md with details as to what it is and how it is supposed to look like.

---

since the graphical assets are most time consuming to develop initiators behind voodoo opted for using assets that were already available to them to some extent.

thus the compositions were chosen initialy as follows:

1. ecceHomo 2014 -> follow up to ecceHomo 2013 this time all svg
2. something out of nothing ->
3. possessed ->
4. rec-convo-the-edge -> this composition is actually finished and ended up here only to fill in a blank no. 4 so it might be replaced one a worthy candidate comes along. in the meantime see the composition here: http://rec-convo-the-edge.surge.sh/ while the source here https://github.com/weAreThePlayMakers/rec-convo-the-edge
5. #bleach_v16_62 -> [github repo](https://github.com/rafszul/-bleach_v16_62) and very heavy and ancient version for those ready to wait till it loads: [_bleach_v16_62.surge.sh](http://_bleach_v16_62.surge.sh/)

---

as you can see all these have some stuff already there; there is much more to do and we have some potential changes in mind so we'll see. in the meantime see what's there.
