and we will talk things through.

---

each composition resides in a separate directory and contains separate README.md with details as to what it is and how it is supposed to look like.

---

since the graphical assets are most time consuming to develop initiators behind voodoo opted for using assets that were already available to them to some extent.

thus the compositions were chosen as follows:

1. ecceHomo 2014
2. something out of nothing
3. possessed
4. rec-convo-the-edge
5. #bleach_v16_62
